# Joalor64 Engine Rewritten
A work in progress remake of the original [Joalor64 Engine](https://github.com/Joalor64GH/Joalor64-Engine).

# Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine
Engine originally used on [Mind Games Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107), intended to be a fix for the vanilla version's many issues while keeping the casual play aspect of it. Also aiming to be an easier alternative to newbie coders.
