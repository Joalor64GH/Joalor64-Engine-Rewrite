hi how are ya
-------------------------------------------------------------
Just wanted to say thanks for downloading!
If you don't know already, this is just a remake of Joalor64 Engine.
I started working on this because I sort of became bored one day.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Update Status:

I decided to finally get back to this project once again!
Sure, it may have been about a year or so since the last update,
but I'll still at least try to get Version 1.4.0 out as soon as I can!
-------------------------------------------------------------
So, yeah. That's pretty much it!
I hope you enjoy!
