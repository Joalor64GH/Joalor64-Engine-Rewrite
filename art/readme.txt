hi how are ya
-------------------------------------------------------------
Just wanted to say thanks for downloading!
If you don't know already, this is just a remake of Joalor64 Engine.
I started working on this because I sort of became bored one day.
-------------------------------------------------------------
I also got inspiration from the following:

Forever Engine - Yoshubs
Funkin Cocoa - TheWorldMachinima
Kade Engine - KadeDev
Chain Saw Engine - MAJigsaw77
Denpa Engine - AT
TopoConnection and Forever Engine Underscore - BeastlyGhost/Gabi
Mic'd Up - Verwex
Gamer Engine - Mealthy/Betopia
Psych Forever Engine - ClassicBoost
Mag Engine - magnumsrt
Pull Requests - Psych Engine GitHub Contributors
-------------------------------------------------------------
So, yeah. That's pretty much it!
I hope you enjoy!
